# HTML5 Drag & Drop and Ember

## It's easy, but limited

It sort of sucks for moving data outside of the browser because `setData` is
brokenish and support is questionable in IE. More importantly it kind of sucks
for moving stuff around on the page because you can't lock the axis of
movement or constrain movement in any way.

BUT, if those subtilities aren't a big deal to you, then it's a pretty quick
way to integrate drag and drop without any external dependencies.
